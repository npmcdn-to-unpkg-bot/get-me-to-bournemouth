## Hack Bournemouth ##

This was a one day hack developed for an event called '[Hack Bournemouth](http://hackbmth.org)' 

## How it works ##

The site is just javascript and HTML using...
* [TransportAPI's public transport journey planning API](https://developer.transportapi.com/documentation/public-journey-planning) in 'region=southeast' mode (using Traveline Southeast at the back end)
* Open licensed ODbL maps from [OpenStreteMap.org](http://openstreetmap.org)
* Tiles from the 'standard' OpenStreetMap tile server CC-BY-SA ([usage policy](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy))
* Map presentation javascript library is [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for ajax and DOM.
